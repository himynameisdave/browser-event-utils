# Migration Guide

This guide is a simple overview of the major version upgrades this package has had over the course of its lifetime.

**Note** that _in general_ no major version has removed any core functionality, so anyone using version `1.x` should be able to safely bump to `3.x`+ without any problems.

## v1.x to 2.x

No breaking changes, this library was re-written in TypeScript.

## 2.x to 3.x

Significantly increases the scope of this project by adding many new utils. However the existing utils are functionally equivalent, so there should be no functional changes, although you may see improved type hinting.
