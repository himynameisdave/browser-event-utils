### Installation

This package is available on NPM, and you can install it with `npm` or `yarn`:

```
npm install browser-event-utils

yarn add browser-event-utils
```

**Browser/UMD**

If you want to just import this library directly in the browser, you can add the following script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/browser-event-utils/bin/index.umd.js" />
```

This will expose a `browserEventUtils` global, on which you will find all of the utility methods.
